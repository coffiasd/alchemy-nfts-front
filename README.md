## init our project with hardhat

run npx init command
and then add OpenZeppelin smart contract library to our project
add dotenv library to our project too. It's useful when we need to add a .env config file which we don't need to commit to our git repo.

```
npm init
npx hardhat init
npm i --save @openzeppelin/contracts
npm i --save dotenv
```
